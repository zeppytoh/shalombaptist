        <h4>What is the essential message of Christianity?</h4>
            <p>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. He made everything good, and the apex of creation is mankind. You and I have been made in the image of God.</p>

            <h5>We were created to glorify God and enjoy him forever</h5>
  <p>The Bible declares that we were placed here, not by chance as secular humanism tells us, but by a loving God who made us to know and enjoy his goodness, and to respond by loving him. But we have been separated from his perfect holiness because collectively, the human race chose not to obey and worship God as God, but to serve and pursue our own ends. As a result, the world is no longer as it should be, because we are not living as we should live - in communion with our Creator God, who reveals himself as Our Father.</p>
          <h5>God sent his Son</h5>
   <img style="float:left; padding-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 1em;"src="http://placehold.it/80x80"/><p>We would not expect any father to leave his children in their plight even if they were the ones who chose to be there. So God pursued us, being born as a man to identify with our condition. All this so that in the end He could take our place to pay the penalty for our rebellion against the Cosmic King, and to win us back to himself through his kindness and mercy.</p>
            <h5>You can return to God</h5>
            <p>When you come to see the reality of this state of affairs, and choose to trust what God says, you will be able to receive God's loving and generous work of salvation on our behalf. </p>
              <p>While we were yet enemies and sinners, God reached down to us through Jesus Christ, who claims to be God incarnate. He lived the life we cannot attain to, and died the death we should have died, and on the cross paid the penalty for our rebellion against God. Then he rose after being buried for three days, to prove that his words were true.</p>
